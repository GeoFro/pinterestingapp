## Open Source Development

Visit app online: http://geofro-pinterestingapp.herokuapp.com/ 
This is demonstrating how powerful open source collaboration / Github is.

I forked your app (copied to make my own changes), cloned onto my computer to update it, commited back to Github, and now I'm submitting a change back to you.

You can review and integrate this with your main branch if you want, or not if you don't.

This is how open source stuff like Bitcoin is developed, with tons of people forking their own little copies and requesting to add one new upgrade at a time.  For something as big as Bitcoin there is also discussion around every change by lots of the most committed members. 

The whole meaning of Open Source though is that anyone can fork and resubmit to the main repository, and even though most people can't, won't and don't, for the programming master race members they sometimes will. 

The whole Linux operating system was built in exactly this way too, which nowadays is the software running behind Android.

## Markdown Resources

Good resources I've found for learning / editing "Markdown", the language for Readme files:
